# Oblivion
Originally supposed to be something else, **Oblivion** is a HTML inspector and a Web Scrapper, allowing you to get the HTML without ever opening the site, checking its status code, the presence of keywords and letting you know about all the `<a>` links in the website.

Fully written in Python, it uses modules like `requests` for response handling and `BeautifulSoup4` for HTML parsing.
